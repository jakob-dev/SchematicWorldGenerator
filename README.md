WorldSchematics is a Minecraft plugin developed for version 1.21.1 that allows you to save extremely large world sections—including blocks, entities, and tile entities—as compressed NBT schematics. 
It features a custom world generator that lets you create entirely new worlds populated by these saved structures without the cost of performance.
